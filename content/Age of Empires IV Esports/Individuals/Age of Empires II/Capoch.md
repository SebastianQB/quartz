-   ### Patricio "[Capoch](https://liquipedia.net/ageofempires/Capoch)" Olmo, #Argentinian, 34.
	-   Part of [[Imperiales]]
    -   This dude is the definition of both early talent and a late bloomer. From 2000 to 2007 he was among the best players, then sat out for over a decade and came back to massive wins. Nuts.
    -   Has Dad Buff thanks to his daughter.
    -   Great work ethic to train for events.
